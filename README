Rquires oauth2 libraries.  Install with

sudo easy_install oauth2


The code requires a CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET from yammer to authorise your application 
to access their network. The first time it runs after that you'll have to go through a 
verification/ PIN entry process.

The script does a query first, then tries to send a message.  You'll need to fill out either 
GROUP_ID (the group you want to send a message to) or ME_ID (the ID of a user you'd like to 
send a message to) to send a message.  You then need to edit the params block, either to 
include group_id if you want to send to a group, or comment that line out and add in 
'direct_to_id' to send a private message.


You can modify the initial query to query group and user IDs, by setting the query url to

https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/users.xml
or
https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/groups.xml

Those xml urls can also be json urls, depending on what sort of results format you'd prefer to consume.
